Our system is a reservation and inventory system for AdventureXP,
and as such, we communicate with the terms Reservation, Activity, Inventory
and Items.

A Reservation contains information about an Activity at a specific time, with
a group of people with a specific name.

An Activity is an event hosted by AdventureXP, like Go-Karting or Paintball.
An Activity also has some collection of Items that must be available to make
the Activity possible.

Inventory is the collection of Items which are property of AdventureXP and must
be available for some sort of Activity.

Our system allows for the creation of reservations, as well as the management
of the inventory required to enable the activities to fulfill those reservations.

tl;dr
The system manages reservations for a group activity organization, and also keeps
track of the inventory of things needed for those activities.
